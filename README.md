## Developer perspective:
This is a demo **android** app where the primary function of the app is to search for Recipes in the [Food2fork API](https://food2fork.ca/ "Food2fork API") and display them in a list built in Jetpack Compose components.

When you type a search query in the search bar at the top of the screen or click a Category Chip at the bottom of the Search Bar, RecipeApplication will call the Food2fork API, display a Shimmer loading effect and list all recipes when fetched.

With ***3000+*** recipes, there is also a **Pagination** logic where you can have a smooth scrolling behavior without draining phone resources.

All UI elements were created using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose "Jetpack Compose").

This application is also structured to have **MVVM architecture** with **clean code principles**.
