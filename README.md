# RecipeApplication

## End user perspective:

This is an android application where the primary function of the app is to search for Recipes and display them
in a list.

In addition to searching, Recipes can also be searched and filtered by Category Chips located under the Search
Bar. There are 9 scrollable Chips to choose from, including Chicken, Beef, Soup, Pizza, and more.

#### Recipes

When one of the recipes is clicked, a navigation will take place to the Recipe Details screen and the details
of the recipe will be displayed.

#### Recipe Details

## Developer perspective:

This is a demo **android** app where the primary function of the app is to search for Recipes in
the [Food2fork API](https://food2fork.ca/ "Food2fork API") and display them in a list built in Jetpack Compose
components.

When you type a search query in the search bar at the top of the screen or click a Category Chip at the bottom
of the Search Bar, RecipeApplication will call the Food2fork API, display a Shimmer loading effect and list
all recipes when fetched.

With ***3000+*** recipes, there is also a **Pagination** logic where you can have a smooth scrolling behavior
without draining phone resources.

All UI elements were created
using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose "Jetpack Compose").

This application is also structured to have **MVVM architecture** with **clean code principles**.
